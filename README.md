# ViWiki
A basic but very visual Wikipedia client. Demo app to show my Android knowledge.

## Issues and discoveries (will update during the development)
- To implement a regular SearchView, an additional Activity must be used. Thus, this won't be a single activity app.
- When the stack trace doesn't go deep enough, add a try-catch(print) block in the error line.
